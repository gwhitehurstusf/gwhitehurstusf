**gwhitehurstusf/gwhitehurstusf** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my first independent project, "Multivariate Analysis of Cardiovascular Risk Factors." 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply foundational data science knowledge to form mulitvariate analysis. My learning has led me to base my future conclusions by practice of advanced statistical methods using regression theory and multivariate normal distributions.     
- 🤔 I’m currently an active member of Professor Loni Hagen's Big Data Analytics Lab at the University of South Florida. 
- 💬 Ask me about what I think about the future of AI.
